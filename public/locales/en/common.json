  "_preguntas_frecuentes": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "coche_pregunta": "Whose car is it?",
  "coche_respuesta": "If the company requests a closed service for its employees, the car belongs to one of the employees. The idea is that they organize themselves so there is always someone offering seats and others booking them. If the company allows employees to share rides with any app user, the car can belong to any of our verified users.",
  "beneficios_pregunta": "If I act as a driver, what are the financial benefits?",
  "beneficios_respuesta": "They depend on how often you use the platform and the number of available seats you offer. We guarantee that half of the trip costs are covered on every shared ride.",
  "pasajeros_pregunta": "Do passengers pay? How much?",
  "pasajeros_respuesta": "Yes. Depending on the distance, passengers pay one amount or another. We keep fares as low as possible to stay highly competitive with other alternatives.",
  "gastos_pregunta": "What costs are associated for the company?",
  "gastos_respuesta": "The company and SharetoGo evaluate the situation together and reach the best possible agreement. Requesting a trial can be the first step.",
  "servicios_pregunta": "Besides mobility management, can the company benefit from other services?",
  "servicios_respuesta": "Yes. Through the website, the company can access an intranet with all its general data and employee-level data closely tied to sustainability and compliance with new regulations.",
  "obligatorio_pregunta": "Is it mandatory to go and return with the same person?",
  "obligatorio_respuesta": "No. Driver: you don’t have to take the same people on the outbound and return trips unless you published a journey covering both legs. Passenger: you don’t have to return in the same car you used to leave unless you booked a round trip with the same driver.",
  "espera_pregunta": "How long should I wait if the driver or passenger doesn’t arrive?",
  "espera_respuesta": "Driver: wait for passengers at the agreed meeting point for at least 15 minutes after the scheduled time. Passenger: wait for the driver at the agreed meeting point for at least 15 minutes after the scheduled time.",
  "anulacion_pregunta": "If I cancel, is the money refunded?",
  "anulacion_respuesta": "Driver: if the driver cancels the trip after receiving payment, they must refund passengers the full amount. If the driver arrives more than 20 minutes late, the full amount is also refunded to the passenger. Passenger: if you cancel 24 hours in advance, you receive a full refund; if you cancel less than 24 hours but more than 30 minutes before the trip, the amount is split half for the driver and half for the passenger; if you cancel less than 30 minutes before departure, you don’t receive a refund and the driver gets the full amount.",
  "politicas_pregunta": "Where can I find all the details of SharetoGo’s policies?",
  "politicas_respuesta": "Email us at contactosharetogo@gmail.com or call us via the contact section with any questions. You can also visit our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions of Use.",
